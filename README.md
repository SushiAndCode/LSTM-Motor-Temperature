## Overview
This repository presents an LSTM model designed to predict the temperature of an electric motor's rotor. The model was developed as part of the 2023 [Motostudent](https://www.motostudent.com/) Innovative Project, where it earned second place. 

## System Integration
The LSTM model was integrated into a performance analysis software used to monitor the telemetry data of our electric prototype. By processing the real-time data from the vehicle, the model predicts the temperature of the motor's internal components. Monitoring rotor temperature is crucial, as elevated temperatures can significantly degrade performance, making these predictions vital for optimizing system efficiency and reliability.
